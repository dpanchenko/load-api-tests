1. Is the main task of the test assignment is to upload data from the files into DB and check all test cases?
1. Yes, exactly

2. This part of the task is unclear:
EMAIL
Create multiple emails for patients who have CONSENT as Yes within the file
Day1
Day2
Day3
Day4

Could clarify a bit more?
2. The idea is to write code that schedules an email to every patient that has the CONSENT field set to ‘Yes’. There should be an email for every day listed in the cadence.

3. Uploading for data in-cab should be done as a preparation stage for running the test or as a separate script?
3. They can implement that however they want, the idea is that they are writing code that does data processing so they should figure out a way to test that it works

4. What is the data build automation yes framework? 
4. Build automation just means that whatever test method they use should be created in a way that can be called during a typical CI\CD process

5. How functioning DB should be implemented in the test assignment?
5. Up to them, they can assume a local copy of Mongo is installed and provide a seed script or they can use a hosted Mongo DB

Part of this is we are looking for some creativity from the candidates to put something together rather than dictate every detail. Yes, there needs to be some relational connection between the collections and they can store the day indication however they want. That’s not really the point. The point is that they create a system that meets the requirements with the appropriate testing mechanism to ensure whatever they did works. 

It’s OK for them to make assumptions and decisions to move forward. This is how we expect our developers to work in general. We do not micro-manage every design detail.
